## 3. Structural Design Patterns

Structural Design Patterns are concerned with the definition of classes.

The Structural Patterns in the original GoF Patterns Book are:

| Pattern  | Intent |
|----------|--------|
| Adapter  | Adapt a class's interface to another interface that a client expects. |
| Bridge   | Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. |
| Composite | Compose objects into collections so that clients can treat individual objects and composite objects the same. |
| Decorator | Add new responsibilities to a class or object, without modifying the original class's code. |
| Facade | Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. |
| Flyweight | Enable objects to be shared (reused) to reduce number of objects, by externalizing state. |
| Proxy | Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. |

You have already seen Adapter, Composite, and Decorator many times.
