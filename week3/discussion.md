## Summary of Last Week

From last week's assigned reading, the most substantial chapter was chapter 6 on Use Cases.

Some highlights from Chapter 6 are:
- Use Cases primarily describe functional requirements
- There are 3 levels of detail you can use (p. 49):
  - brief - one paragraph summary
  - casual - paragraph style, using several paragraphs to describe it.
  - fully dressed - step by step description, using a template
- Most popular template: usecases.org doesn't exist anymore
- What Sections to Include? (p. 54)
  - "*Only place elements at the start which are important to read before the main success scenario.*"
  - "Primary Actor" is important
  - "Stakeholders and Interests" is usually important
- for many applications, focus on Use Cases at the level of "*Elementary Business Practices*" (EBPs).
  > EBP is a task performed by one person in one place at one time, in response to a business event, which adds measurable [business] value and leaves data in a consistent state.
- Finding Actors, Goals, and Use Cases (section 6.9, p. 64)
  - List of steps to perform
  - Create an Actor-Goal List
- Your Initial Use Cases Won't Be Correct
  - plan to revise & refactor them
  - delete some
  - break down some into smaller goals
  - combine some into larger composite goals

- Wikipedia page on "Use Case" looks very good as a summary
  - but lacks "how to"
  - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case>

## Why It Is Difficult (Nearly Impossible) to Write Good Use Cases in Class

We are discovering requirements "in a vacuum".

We don't have the actual customers or stakeholders here to participate in the discussion.

This is in Section 6.10 "*The Need for Communication and Participation*"
