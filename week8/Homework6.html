 <h1>Homework 6</h1>
 

 <h2>Team Assignment</h2>
 <p>
 By the lab next week please have:
 <ol>
 <li>Running code for "vote for projects" use case.
 <ul>
 <li>display something to vote on with choices,
 and accept a vote.
 <li>have a desktop GUI or web-based UI.
 <li>app knows <em>who</em> is voting, even if you don't
 use authentication.
 <li>records vote in a log4j log file (at least).
 </ul>
 
 <li>
 Software level sequence diagram that shows how your
 software handles this use case, and class diagram 
 that shows the structure.
 <li>
 Code must be checked in to VCS.
 <li>
 Assign each person on your team the task of writing JUnit 4
 tests for at least one class (different class for each person)
 that the person is writing.
 </ol>

 <h2>Individual Assignment</h2>

 <p>
 Write JUnit 4 tests for at least one class you wrote for the
 team assignment. Write meaningful tests
 for behavior, not trivial tests (testing simple get/set methods
 are trivial and usually omitted).
 Write tests for desired <em>behavior</em>, especially
 <em>borderline cases</em>, rather than methods.
 <p>
 Consider using <em>Test Driven Development</em> (Larman Chapter 21,
 or search the web).  
 In TDD, you decide on the desired behavior
 first (including things you <em>don't</em> want to happen)
 and write unit tests for it.  At first, the tests fail or won't
 compile because you haven't written the code to test yet.
 Write stubs ("do nothing" methods) for the code to test 
 and start writing real methods -- testing as you code.
