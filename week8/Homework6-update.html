 <h2>Olympics Scorekeeper</h2>
  <p>
  The Olympics Gymnastics consists of events or competitions,
  such as "Parallel bars".
  Each event has one or more rounds.
  In each round, the contestants perform and are evaluated by 
  a panel of judges.
  <p>
  After each contestant's performance (in a single round), 
  the judges each award a score to the performance;
  the score is a number --
  usually a floating point number between 0 and 10 with one
  decimal digit, such as 8.7.
  The judges' scores are combined to get a 
  single score for the contestant's performance.
  <br/>
  <em>How the judges scores</em> are combined may vary: 
  in some events the judges' scores are simply averaged 
  (often the highest and lowest scores are discarded and
  the rest are averaged).
  In other events the judges scores are averaged and then 
  multiplied by a difficulty factor for the contestant's performance
  (e.g. a "triple flip" may have a difficulty factor of 3.2).
  <p>
  If the event has more than one round, then the contestant's final
  score is the sum of his scores from each round.
  The winner of the event is the contestant with the highest total
  score.

  <ol>
  <li>
      Construct a domain model 
      for the olympics gymnastics.
      The model should be able to handle multiple events.
	  <br/>&nbsp;<br/>
  <li>
      Assign these responsibilities to classes: 
    <ul>
	<li>
	  assign score (judge awards a score to a performance)
	<li>
	  know all the scores for a contestant -- know the individual
	  scores from each judge for each round
	<li>
	  compute a contestant's overall score for a single performance
	<li>
	  compute a contestant's total score (total of all performances)
	<li>
	  rank the contestants and compute the winner
	<li>
	  know the judges -- how do we get the judges for a competition?
	<li>
	  know the contestants -- who are the contestants in a competition?
    </ul>
	<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
   </li>
   <li>
      Name as least one more responsibility. You can include
	  <em>creation</em> responsibilities.
   </ol>

   <h3>What to Submit</h3>
   <ol>
   <li>
    A class diagram that shows the above information.
	Its a software or implementation level class diagram since it
	includes assignment of responsibilities, and may include
	<em>pure fabrication</em> classes.
    <br/>&nbsp;<br/>
   <li>
    A table giving the <em>reason</em> why you assigned each
	responsibility to each class.  Reasons should be clear 
	and concise. GRASP principles and LRG are good reasons.
	"High cohesion" is not sufficient reason -- you must explain how
	an assignment achieves higher cohesion than other choices.
	
	<table align="center" border="1" width="90%">
	<tr>
	<th>Responsibility</th> <th>Assigned to</th> <th width="50%">Reason</th>
	</tr>
	<tr valign="top">
	<td>Assign score<br>for performance</td>
	<td><em>which class?</em></td>
	<td><em>why?</em>
	</td>
	</tr>
