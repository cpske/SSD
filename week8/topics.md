## Object Design and Assigning Responsibilites

Object Design refers to the design of software objects (classes) that will lead to software meeting the user's requirements.

The most important knowledge for object design (according to Larman) is:
- principles of responsibility assignment
- design patterns

(Section 14.3, "On to Object Design")

Design Patterns are themselves guided by some design principles, so, by
extension, you should know those principles, too.

The most important UML diagrams for object design are interaction diagrams:
- Sequence Diagram
- Collaboration Diagram

Chapter 15 covers the common syntax for these diagrams.
