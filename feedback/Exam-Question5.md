Exam Question 5 asked: In a layered design how can lower layer objects
communicate with higher layer objects, such as for notifications,
without being coupled to higher layer objects? (which we don't want)

This was the same as Homework 10, Question 2.

The following students could not answer exam question 5 at all,
or submitted a totally incorrect answer.

Since I suspect a lot of copying on Homework 10, anyone who could
not answer exam question 5 *at all* does not get credit for HW10
question 2.
